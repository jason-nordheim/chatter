# Chatter One

This is a simple chat room application. It enables the sending of images and text in a chat room.

A live version of the application is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at [https://chatter-one.netlify.app/](https://chatter-one.netlify.app/).

## Logging in

**Important** - This application does NOT currently support creating accounts. This will be the next feature to be implemented.

To login to the sample app, use either of the following demo accounts:

| username     | password     |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `helloWorld` | `helloWorld` |
| `fooBar`     | `fooBar`     |

## Run it Locally

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jason-nordheim/chatter-one.git`
2. Change to the root of the project directory: `cd chatter-one`
3. Install NPM packages: `npm install`
4. Run the start script: `npm start`

This will open start the application in development mode running on port `3000`
